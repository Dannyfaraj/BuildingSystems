JModelica
=========

The majority of the examples of the BuildingSystems library are running with [JModelica](https://jmodelica.org/).

To perform a simulation experiment with JModelica following preparation steps have to be done:

## Installation of JModelica
Download JModelica from [JModelica.org](https://jmodelica.org).
The easiest way is to install the [Windows installer](https://jmodelica.org/downloads/JModelica.org-2.2.exe).

## Running a simulation experiment
The Folder BuildingSystems/Resources/Scripts/JModelica contains Python Scripts
which define exactly the same simulation experiments as in the folder with the
mos-files for simulation experiments with Dymola.
